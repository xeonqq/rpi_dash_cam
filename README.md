  `rpi dash cam` uses raspberrypi + rpi camera to create your own dashcam. It supports button control and LED indication. Very simple and minmal code. Most importantly, **it has no frame drop**!

  During recording `rpi dash cam` requires very little CPU and memory source, it uses techniques like *Theading* and *Event Queue* to handle the workload between capturing and buffer saving. Thus solves the frame dropping problem many people are facing when recording long-duration video.
  
  *Tested on RPI3 model B with rpi camera V2*. [Demo video](https://youtu.be/LCdgOeGI45s).
